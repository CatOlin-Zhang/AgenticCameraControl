# Camera Control Skill

## When to Use

Trigger when the user wants to discover, view, capture, record, move (PTZ), monitor (events/alarm), adjust (illumination/image), or track with IP cameras on the same LAN. Everyday single-step asks this covers: "what cameras are on my network?"; "show me the front-door feed" (screenshot / RTSP link / WebRTC preview); "record 30 seconds"; "pan up to check the roof"; "alert me and snapshot when someone passes"; "too dark: raise the brightness / turn on the fill light"; "set line-crossing detection at the garage entrance".

The frames, event records, and stream URLs this skill produces also power higher-level, multistep tasks:

- **Visual Q&A** — read a captured frame to answer questions like "has my package arrived?" or "did I leave the warehouse light on?", then act on the answer (e.g. switch to night mode)
- **Event-driven automation** — on a motion/human/vehicle alarm, auto-snapshot, pan toward the subject, or chain follow-up steps
- **Periodic comparison** — capture at intervals and compare frames (construction progress, water level)
- **Downstream hand-off** — pass the `stream_url` or event store to external consumers (CV pipeline, NVR, alert platform)
- **Multi-camera patrol** — sweep all connected cameras and summarize which areas show activity

## Running Mode: MCP Server (stdio transport)

`scripts/mcp_server.py` runs as an MCP server over **stdio transport only** — it is **not** a network service (no port, no `localhost` URL). The MCP client **launches it as a child process** (config below) and exchanges JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout; the Agent interacts with all camera tools exclusively through this channel, and per-session connection state lives in that child process's memory.

## Installation

If `xpai-camera-control` tools are not present in the available tool set, follow these steps:

**Step 1 — Determine SKILL_ROOT:** the absolute path of the directory containing this SKILL.md, or run `python -c "from scripts._paths import get_skill_root; print(get_skill_root())"`.

**Step 2 — Install dependencies:** `"<MCP_PYTHON>" -m pip install -r <SKILL_ROOT>/requirements.txt` — `<MCP_PYTHON>` is the absolute path of the same 64-bit Python interpreter configured for the MCP server in Step 3. Always install through `-m pip` on that exact interpreter: a bare `pip` may belong to a different Python environment.

**Step 3 — Write MCP config:** append the following JSON to the host's MCP config file (replace `<SKILL_ROOT>` with the actual path from Step 1):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xpai-camera-control": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["<SKILL_ROOT>/scripts/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Config notes:** `args` must stay an absolute path — do not rely on `cwd` (host support for `cwd` varies). On Windows, write the path with forward slashes or escaped backslashes (`\\`) so the JSON stays valid. `command` must be the same 64-bit Python interpreter used in Step 2 — use its absolute path if it is not the `PATH` `python`. Common config locations: Claude Desktop `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Win) / `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS); Cursor Settings → MCP → Add Server; Cline `.cline/mcp_settings.json`.

**Native library (camera-proto):** the native library is delivered as the pinned pip dependency `camera-proto==0.2.0`, installed together with the other dependencies in Step 2 — installation happens at setup time, never at MCP startup. The MCP server starts normally even if the package is missing; the first camera tool call then returns an error containing the exact fix command to run — `"<MCP_PYTHON>" -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, with the actual interpreter path and requirements file filled in. After installing, simply retry the tool — no server restart needed (the loader retries on the next call). On startup, the first import runs a one-shot dependency self-check and writes a single stderr line with the actual interpreter path and the camera-proto status — read it first when diagnosing. Startup output goes to stderr, never to the JSON-RPC stdout channel.

## MCP-Only Interaction (Hard Rule)

All camera operations **MUST** go through the MCP tools exposed by `scripts/mcp_server.py`. If the tools are **not present** in your available tool set, do NOT fall back to scripting — follow the [Installation](#installation) steps first, then call the tools; if server startup fails, report the stderr reason and resolve it before retrying.

- **NEVER** import `scripts.toolkit` (or any module inside this package) directly, and **NEVER** write standalone scripts that re-implement or wrap tool functionality — direct imports bypass the skill's security constraints (explicit user confirmation, parameter validation) and the in-memory connection state held by the MCP server process, so scripted calls in a separate process silently violate both.

## Single-Instance Limitation

The MCP server is **stateful and single-instance** — camera connections and RTSP sessions live in one server process's memory, and an instance lock (port bind, see Gotchas) keeps only one *camera-active* instance at a time (concurrent camera users would fight for the device's RTSP session slots and hang the camera). The lock is acquired **lazily on the first camera-using tool call**, never at startup — so every session always sees the full tool list, and camera-*free* tools (`get_registered_cameras`, `register_camera`, `search_devices`) work everywhere. A newer session **takes over** the lock from an older one (the older instance is shut down): latest user wins.

**Agent instruction:** before starting camera work (or the first time camera tools are invoked in a session), proactively tell the user in plain language:

> The camera feature has a usage limitation: only one session can "hold" the camera at a time (the connection state is stored in a single background service). When a new session starts using the camera, it automatically takes over: the other session's camera connection is dropped and its camera tools stop working. If you switch back, just retry the camera action in this window — it takes the camera back the same way.

If a camera-using tool call returns an `instance_lock_conflict` error, the lock port is occupied by a non-skill program or takeover failed — relay `error_message` to the user (it names the holding PID), resolve, then retry. Missing tools alone do not establish a lock conflict: check registration and startup stderr first.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 0 — Session Init (must be done at the very beginning of the session)

At the beginning of each session, check if there are any registered cameras in config.yaml:

1. Call `get_registered_cameras()` to read the camera configurations (including credentials) saved in config.yaml
2. For each registered camera, call `connect_device(cam.name)` — the tool uses the cached credentials in config.yaml automatically, **no need for the user to input a password again**. Credential retry and cloud re-authorization are handled internally; if credentials keep failing, the tool auto-removes the registration and returns `status="needs_password"`
   - **If this is the first camera work after a long idle period (hours/days), or a call on a previously working camera fails, call `search_devices()` first** — a camera's IP can change while idle (DHCP lease renewal) and the cached IP in config.yaml goes stale. `search_devices()` re-registers reachable cameras with their current IP and removes cameras that are gone; then retry. Never retry repeatedly against a stale cached IP.
3. If config.yaml is empty or all registered cameras fail to connect → enter Phase 1

### Phase 1 — Discover Cameras

When Phase 0 cache is unavailable, call `search_devices()` to discover cameras on the local network — it automatically selects the best available discovery protocol(s); the Agent does not choose:

- Results come back as a unified `DiscoveredDevice` list: XPAI-specific metadata (SN, channels, MAC, etc.) under `sky_*` fields when available, plus `discovery_method` and `protocol_type`
- `protocol_type` is conclusive only for **`S`** (device answered SK private discovery — full feature set); **empty** means found via JCP/WS-Discovery with no class asserted. `J`/`O` are resolved and persisted by `connect_device` via an authoritative SK-first unicast probe — a JCP answer alone proves nothing (JCP discovery is shared by both S- and J-class firmware), and **`O`** (third-party ONVIF-only) is asserted only when SK/JCP stay silent but the ONVIF admission probe passes (port probe + `GetDeviceInformation`). See the capability matrix below.
- **Search also syncs config.yaml**: reachable discovered cameras are written in with basic info (name, IP, SN, device class, ports — never a password), and registered cameras no longer discoverable **and** unreachable are removed. Re-running `search_devices()` is the supported way to refresh the registry after an IP change, a newly added camera, or a camera that left the network.

**Camera Naming:** when multiple cameras are found, list them (IP, model, SN) and assign a friendly name to each: use user-provided names if the user gives them; otherwise default to auto-naming — capture a screenshot via `capture_video_screenshot()`, generate a scene-descriptive name (e.g. "entrance hallway"), and present it for user confirmation before saving. Pass the chosen name as `name` to `connect_device()` / `register_camera()`; `register_camera` matches by name → IP → SN, so a new name + same IP renames in-place.

### Phase 2 — Connect & Authorize

Call `connect_device()` for each camera. The tool handles auth internally (cloud authorization, cached credentials, direct connect). **Agent only reacts to the returned `status`** — see [Decision Table](#decision-table--error--status--action) for mapping.

**Cloud-authorization pre-notice (required):** cloud authorization blocks `connect_device` for up to 5 minutes until the user approves, and the request is pushed **only to the phone App this camera is bound to**. Whenever a `connect_device` call may enter cloud authorization (e.g. a password-required camera with no cached password), **tell the user before the call** (in the user's language): open the phone App this camera is bound to and tap **Approve** on the authorization request — the call will then spin for up to 5 minutes. Without this notice the user sees only a spinner and does not know to act.

### Phase 3 — Stream & Capture

After a successful connection:
- `capture_video_screenshot()` — single JPEG frame from the RTSP stream (auto-discards initial buffered frames for a clean capture)
- `get_audio_video_stream()` — returns the RTSP `stream_url` and validates availability (codec/resolution/fps metadata)
- `toggle_recording()` — starts/stops local MP4 recording from the RTSP stream via ffmpeg remux (`-c:v copy`)
- `manage_storage_status()` — disk usage and storage path/format/policy configuration
- `start_webrtc_stream()` / `stop_webrtc_stream()` — RTSP→WebRTC browser live preview (returns HTTP access URL). If the browser preview stutters or goes black (e.g. Edge has no H265 WebRTC), retry with `start_webrtc_stream(video_codec="h264")` — switches the device encoder (device-wide, briefly interrupts its RTSP sessions) then restarts the preview

Screenshots are saved to `snapshots/` by default; recordings go to `video/`.

**Result delivery (when the user wants to "see" a camera):** after the capture + stream probe, the Agent **MUST** deliver both: (1) show the screenshot image (markdown `![screenshot](file_path)`), (2) provide the `stream_url` so the user can open it in a media player (VLC, ffplay, PotPlayer, etc.) — or (3) call `start_webrtc_stream()` for a browser-based live preview if the user prefers a visual player over a raw RTSP URL.

**Obtaining go2rtc (only when `start_webrtc_stream()` reports go2rtc is not detected):** go2rtc is a third-party single-binary RTSP→WebRTC streaming tool (~15MB) and is not bundled with this skill. When missing, obtain it as follows: search for the "go2rtc" project's GitHub Releases page (project name `go2rtc`, author AlexxIT) and download the release binary matching the current platform (on Windows it is a zip archive — extract `go2rtc.exe` from it); place the binary in the skill root directory or add it to `PATH`; then retry `start_webrtc_stream()`.

### Phase 4 — PTZ Control

PTZ backend is chosen by `protocol_type`: **SK-class** uses the XPAI private protocol (vendor command via TCP channel); **J-class and O-class** use **ONVIF only** (`ContinuousMove` / `Stop` / `GetStatus` on the ONVIF PTZ service — no private-protocol fallback). `control_ptz` auto-stops after `duration_seconds` (default 1s); the direction parameter accepts English (`up`/`down`/`left`/`right`) and Chinese aliases (上/下/左/右).

**J/O-class limits:** the ONVIF backend moves by normalized velocity vectors over `duration_seconds`, so **`degrees` mode is not supported** (the tool returns a message asking the user to use `duration_seconds` instead) and there is **no calibration** (`calibrate_ptz` returns an explicit unsupported message).

**Physical Limit Guard:** `control_ptz` validates the command against the PTZ's actual physical travel range at the tool layer — the agent does not pre-validate. If the head is already at the limit the command is intercepted before being sent; if the limit is reached mid-movement (e.g. "turn right 5s" but only 3s of travel remains), the tool stops early and replaces the request with the feasible movement. Both cases return `degraded=True` + a human-readable `degrade_reason`. **The Agent MUST explicitly relay `degrade_reason` to the user whenever `degraded=True`** — never report a degraded move as if it completed as requested.

**PTZ Movement Estimation:** the SDK does not report absolute PTZ angles. To estimate how far the view has shifted after a rotation, capture screenshots before and after, compare the frames visually, and report the estimated shift as a percentage of frame width/height. Best-effort — in featureless scenes (blank walls, sky) the estimate may be unreliable; say so when it is.

If PTZ detailed sequences, degrees mode, or calibration (`calibrate_ptz` set_home/go_home) are needed → [WORKFLOW.md — Phase 4](references/WORKFLOW.md#phase-4--ptz-control-detailed-tool-calls).

## Extended Capabilities & Protocol Matrix

These tools are available when the user explicitly requests them (all require a connected camera). The matrix doubles as the skill-wide per-device-class capability reference:

| Capability | Tools / Actions | `S` (SK) | `J` (JCP) | `O` (ONVIF-only) | Reference |
|-----------|-----------------|:--------:|:---------:|:----------------:|-----------|
| Alarm events (motion/human/vehicle/tamper/…, linked snapshots) | `manage_camera_events`: `start`/`stop`/`poll`/`wait` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | [events.md](references/commands/events.md) |
| Illumination (daynight + fill light; integer value or string alias) | `manage_illumination`: `get`/`set` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | [illumination.md](references/commands/illumination.md) |
| Image params (brightness/contrast/saturation/sharpness/flip) | `manage_image_settings`: `get`/`set` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | [image_settings.md](references/commands/image_settings.md) |
| Detection & tracking (human/vehicle/area/motion/line-crossing) | `query_tracking_capabilities` / `set_tracking` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | [tracking.md](references/commands/tracking.md) |
| PTZ move / stop / status | `control_ptz`, `stop_ptz`, `get_ptz_parameters` | ✅ private protocol | ✅ ONVIF | ✅ ONVIF | [ptz.md](references/commands/ptz.md) |
| PTZ `degrees` mode / calibration | `control_ptz` (`degrees`), `calibrate_ptz` | ✅ | ❌ use `duration_seconds` | ❌ use `duration_seconds` | [ptz.md](references/commands/ptz.md) |
| Streaming / screenshot / recording / WebRTC | stream module tools | ✅ RTSP | ✅ RTSP (ONVIF-authoritative paths) | ✅ RTSP (ONVIF-authoritative paths) | [stream.md](references/commands/stream.md) |
| Discovery | `search_devices` | ✅ SK private | ✅ JCP | ✅ WS-Discovery | [device_mgmt.md](references/commands/device_mgmt.md) |
| Cloud authorization on connect | `connect_device` | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ password only (no SK/JCP SN) | [device_mgmt.md](references/commands/device_mgmt.md) |

> `manage_camera_events(action="start")` spawns a background listener thread; `manage_illumination(action="set")` and `set_tracking` modify hardware settings — all require **explicit user confirmation** before calling. Cloud authorization is handled internally by `connect_device` (blocking call, waits up to 5 minutes for user approval in the phone App the camera is bound to — **pre-notice required**, see Phase 2). J/O-class devices asked for an SK-private-protocol-only capability return `error_code="UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL"` + a clear reason — not a malfunction or timeout.

> **O-class admission:** a WS-Discovery device that never answers SK/JCP discovery is admitted only when the ONVIF admission probe passes (ONVIF port probe + authenticated `GetDeviceInformation`); its ONVIF SerialNumber is persisted as `onvif_sn` (identity/matching only — **never** fed to cloud auth or SK HTTP as `sn_code`). RTSP-reachable devices that fail ONVIF admission are rejected with `status="no_sn"` — final, do not retry with workarounds.

> **Fully-supported models:** [references/SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md](references/SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md) lists the device models carrying the full S-class capability set. Unlisted devices still work, but only with partial functionality. `search_devices()` already returns each camera's model, so consulting the list is an optional advance confirmation — not a required step.

## Security Constraints

- **Explicit prompt:** inform the user and wait for confirmation before PTZ, streaming, screenshots, event monitor start, and illumination/image/tracking changes.
- **Code validation:** tool-layer validation for recording and storage configuration.
- **Background threads:** event listeners start **only** after `events(action="start")`; auto-resume only re-arms previously-enabled listeners.

## Gotchas

- **Never hardcode ONVIF port 80** → always use `onvif_port` from `search_devices()` / config.yaml.
- **Never manually construct RTSP URLs** → always use `stream_url` from `get_audio_video_stream()` (credentials auto-injected).
- **Chinese characters in Windows paths cause `cv2.imwrite()` to silently fail** → no manual workaround needed (the toolkit handles it internally); if you pass a custom `save_path`, prefer ASCII-only paths.
- **Connection state is in-memory only** → on `success=false` with connection error, call `connect_device()` first, then retry.
- **Fixed-duration recording** → always use `toggle_recording(action="start", duration=<seconds>)`. Never implement agent-side sleep → stop.
- **Instance-lock conflict (`instance_lock_conflict` tool error)** → automatic takeover handles the normal case (a live instance of this skill holding the lock is verified via netstat+cmdline, shut down, and replaced — latest user wins). If `error_message` says the port is occupied by *another program*, close that program, then retry; if takeover itself failed, locate the holder from the PID in `error_message` (or `.instance_lease.json` — `pid` field, written once at lock acquisition — or `netstat -ano | findstr <lock_port>`; lock port derived from the skill path) and verify it is this skill's `mcp_server.py` (`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessId=<PID>" | Select CommandLine`), then `taskkill /PID <PID> /F /T` and retry. **Confirm with the user before killing** — it breaks whatever session still owns it. Exit code: `70` = clean shutdown when the stdio session ends.
- **Pure-numeric passwords/SNs must be sent as JSON strings.** → when relaying a user-provided password or SN (e.g. `847226`) into any tool argument, quote it as a string (`"847226"`), never emit a bare JSON number. Tool schemas declare these credential fields as `string` only; a numeric value that survives as a number into YAML/config can later load back as an integer and break credential handling.

## Decision Table — error / status → action

This table is the **single runtime source of truth** for error handling. On any tool failure: analyze the error → apply the mapped action **yourself — self-healing first: this system is Agent-readable by design, so diagnose and recover on your own before involving the user**. Do NOT write workaround scripts or re-implement tool functionality. Report to the user what failed / why / how to fix, then wait for the user's decision — **except** the bounded auto-retry row below.

| `error_message` pattern / `status` | Agent Action |
|------------------------------------|--------------|
| `not_connected` / `device not found` | Call `connect_device()` first, then retry the failed operation. If it still fails — or this is the first operation after a long idle period — call `search_devices()` to refresh stale IPs in the registry, then retry |
| `needs_password` (status) | Cached credentials expired (the cloud re-issued password is the same stale credential, so another App-approval round cannot recover — **do not send the user to re-approve in the App; ask for the current password directly**), cloud service unreachable, the device has no SN so cloud auth cannot start (incl. O-class third-party ONVIF), or the device has no cloud station record (submitted to the default station — the APP may not receive it) — ask user for password → `connect_device(camera_name, password=user_input)` (if the registration was auto-removed, also pass `ip=<the IP from the error message>`) |
| `no_sn` (status) | Connection refused: an S/J-asserted XPAI device lost its SN (retry after `search_devices()`), or a WS-Discovery device failed ONVIF admission (RTSP-only, no ONVIF control plane) — report to user; check ONVIF support/port or supply ONVIF credentials. **Forbidden workaround:** manual `register_camera` / hand-editing config.yaml to bypass the gate |
| `error_code="UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL"` (incl. `not support illumination`) | J/O-class camera asked for an SK-private-protocol-only capability (illumination / image settings / tracking / events) — inform user of the device-class limitation; not a malfunction or timeout |
| `auth_rejected` / `cloud_pwd_failed` / `cached credentials cleared` | Auth-failure group: user denied cloud authorization → inform user, cannot connect; cloud password mismatch → device may have changed password, ask user for the correct one; cached credentials cleared (tool already attempted cloud re-auth) → prompt user for password → `connect_device(camera_name, password=user_input)` |
| `degraded=true` (PTZ result) | **MUST** relay `degrade_reason` to user verbatim |
| `limit_reached=true` | Stop sending PTZ commands in that direction — physical limit reached |
| `stream unavailable` / RTSP failure | Check camera is online, verify network connectivity |
| `error_code="timeout"` (stream/screenshot) | Tool hit its hard timeout budget. Retry once with a larger `timeout_seconds` (max 120); if still failing, check device online status |
| `recording in progress` (screenshot rejected on the same camera) | Camera is recording; stop recording (`toggle_recording` action=stop) before screenshotting the same camera |
| Screenshot/recording write failure (file not created or empty) — causes: disk full, invalid `save_path`, no write permission | Before long recordings: query `manage_storage_status()` (action=query) and judge free space yourself. On failure: check space / path validity / permissions, then clean up or change policy via `manage_storage_status()`, fix the path, and retry |
| `camera-proto package is not installed` (first camera tool call reports the missing package) | Run `"<MCP_PYTHON>" -m pip install -r <SKILL_ROOT>/requirements.txt` (the MCP-launching Python; the tool error prints this command with actual paths), then retry the same tool — no server restart needed |
| `DEVICE_UNREACHABLE` (from private protocol / SK HTTP, on illumination / image / tracking tools, ONVIF connection healthy) | **Bounded auto-retry, no user confirmation needed:** retry the same call with unchanged parameters after 2-3 seconds, up to 3 attempts. Transient private-protocol port flapping; do not reconnect or rediscover. Report only after all retries fail |
| `error_code="instance_lock_conflict"` (tool error) | Lock port occupied by a non-skill program, or takeover failed. The normal "another session of this skill holds the lock" case never surfaces this — it is auto-taken-over. Relay `error_message` (names the holding PID), resolve, then retry; manual recovery → see Gotchas (instance-lock conflict) |

## Configuration

Camera configurations are saved in `config.yaml` (skill root). Credentials auto-persist after first successful connection; sensitive fields (`password` / `sn_code` / `sn` / `pkdk`) are stored obfuscated (never plaintext on disk) and restored in memory only at the point of use. When config.yaml full schema or example configs are needed → [references/CONFIG.md](references/CONFIG.md).
